# NumPy

**NumPy** is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

### Key Features

- **Powerful N-Dimensional Arrays**: NumPy's primary data structure is the ndarray, which allows for efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Includes a wide range of mathematical operations such as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.
- **Broadcasting**: Supports broadcasting, a powerful mechanism that allows numpy to work with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations.
- **Integration with Other Libraries**: Works seamlessly with other scientific computing libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
- **Performance**: Written in C, NumPy operations are highly optimized for performance, making it much faster than traditional Python lists.

### Installation

You can install NumPy using pip:

!pip install numpy


Or 

using conda:

conda install numpy
